qdo: Python worker library for Mozilla Services' message queuing
================================================================

qdo
    pronounced `qu-doe`

This is a Python implementation of a worker library used for processing
queued messages from a MozSvc message queue. More soon, in the meantime,
you can read the `spec <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Services/Sagrada/Queuey>`_
on the Mozilla wiki or look at the message queue implementation called
`Queuey <https://github.com/mozilla-services/queuey>`_ itself.
